/**
 * In this class you will implement a slightly modified version
 * of the Prim-Jarnik algorithm for generating Minimum Spanning trees.
 * The original version of this algorithm will only generate the 
 * minimum spanning tree of the connected vertices in a graph, given
 * a starting vertex. Like Kruskal's, this algorithm can be modified to 
 * produce a minimum spanning forest with very little effort.
 *
 * See the handout for details on Prim-Jarnik's algorithm.
 * Like Kruskal's algorithm this algorithm makes extensive use of 
 * the decorator pattern, so make sure you know it.
